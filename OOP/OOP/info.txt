OOP concepts:
	- Abstraction
	- Encapsulation
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism

*** Abstraction ***

- A mechanism to provide the details about essential features without decribing the background details

*** Encapsulation ***

- A mechanism of binding the object state (fields) and behavior (methods) together into a single unit
- Mainly achieved by creating classes
	- The class is a kind of a container or capsule, which encapsulate the set of fields and methods

*** Inheritance ***

- A mechanism of acquiring the features and behaviors of a class by another class
- The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits thos members is called the derived class

*** Polymorphism ***

- Ability of an object to behave in multiple ways

- Two types:
	- Static (method overloading & operator overloading)
	- Dynamic (method overriding)


*** CLASS ***

- A user defined data structure that contains data members (fields, properties) and member functions (method, constructor, destructor)
- It is a reference type and acts as a template for an object

*** OBJECT ***

- A representative of the class and allocates memory to its class member (fields)
